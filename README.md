# Outrival_two_bot_demo
Using Pipecat AI's framework and WebRTC, connects two LLM bots to have a natural chat with each other. A separate LLM monitors the conversation and enhances the natural effect of the call by helping end it at the correct moment.
There is also an LLM analyzing the call after it ends and gather data from the logs to hepl create data visualization. After the analisys you can access a dashboard to see all the stats of the call.

# To access the dashboard use this command:
- streamlit run dashboard.py



## Use of AI Disclaimer
- dashboard.py and database.py were generated with Claude AI to work around time limitations for the project.
- two_bots.py, conversation_monitor.py, and call_analyzer.py were a mix of hand coding and AI used for debugging and enhancing existing features.
- Refactoring was done initially with AI and then reviewed and edited by hand.
