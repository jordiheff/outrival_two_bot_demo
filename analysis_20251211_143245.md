- Assistance with reservations and restaurant suggestions.

## 2. Turn-Taking Quality
- **Turn-taking:** The bots managed to take turns effectively, with no significant delays between responses. The conversation appeared smooth, with each bot responding promptly after the other.
- **Overlaps/Awkward Patterns:** There was a minor issue with one overlapping response where Sarah provided an incorrect price detail. This error was likely due to a transcription or text generation mistake rather than a turn-taking flaw.
- **Natural Flow:** Overall, the conversation flowed naturally, mimicking a real-life customer service interaction.

- **Relevance:** Responses were relevant and on-topic, addressing the questions and comments made by the other bot.
- **Context Loss/Confusion:** There was no significant context loss. However, the transcription error in Sarah's response about the price could have caused confusion if not immediately rectified. The response cut off, resulting in an incomplete sentence.

## 4. Technical Performance
